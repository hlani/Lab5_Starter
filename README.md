- Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
   
   No, because this "message" feature also involves allowing user to write and send messages to another user. It is too complex to check if a user can write and send a message to another user. Would not be able to apply unit testing because it is only practiced on small functional code that are not integrated. 


- Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

    Yes, you can create a unit test to check if an input has exceed the maximum length or not. It can be tested without relying on any other external features.
